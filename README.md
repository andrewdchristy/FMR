Ferromagnetic Resonance (FMR) data fitting code for my research

First attempt at any academic-scale coding besides an undergrad class, so it's pretty clunky

Currently formatted for rawdatafitting.py to be executed first (includes data loading and most defined functions necessary for later fits)

CoFeBdata.csv is the original data set I used to make this, and is in the format that this script can handle in its current form
